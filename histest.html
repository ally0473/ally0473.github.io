        <p>Sweden's musical history is one that can be rivalled by few. From huge artists like Aviici and ABBA, to lesser known songwriters like Max Martin and Thomas G:Son, Sweden's musical history is widespread. This section will detail the modern history of the nation, looking closely at how pop and folk have merged together to create a musical powerhouse.</p>
        <p>Sweden's musical history, like many others, is steeped in culture and tradition. Throughout history, music played an important role in battles. The Swedish fiddle and nycklharp being important parts of music creation. By the turn on the mid-20th century however, pop music began to have more of an impact across the country. Pop music was not always popular however, with folk music, and even the national broadcaster being against what we now think as normal.</p>
        <p>The timeline below starts in the 1960's, after the creation of the <a href="uc-v1.html">Eurovision Song Contest and Swedish Melodifestivalen</a> but before their first victory. The timeline will detail wins and losses, and political moments, in the Swedish musical masterpiece.</p>
