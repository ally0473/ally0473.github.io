		<p>
			Taking a deep dive look into the music industry of the Kingdom of Sweden, I can show how Swedish music has had a profound impact across the world. From ABBA to Aviici, Swedish music is known worldwide and has a history across generations. Using writings from Johansson and Bjornberg we will explore the history of the music, the artists, and the impact on which they have had. The website design is inspired and supported by Sweden.Se which I will use throughout the project to inspire and learn from, as well as also giving me some background knowledge on the country. The audience will be discussed deeper elsewhere, but focuses on those with an interest Scandinavian music or Eurovision, especially within academia as they are most likely to understand the sources being used. The aim is for those which have a deep interest in academic research in music.
		</p>
		<p>Using images, video, music and text, we will transport you across the history of Swedish music and songwriting, showcasing live performances and achievements. The Swedish music industry is broad, and the research into it is as such. This will be a collection of chronological history backed up by authors and also diving into the impacts in which these events had.</p>
		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>Above is a navigation bar of links to each week of work, within this is the lab tasks for each week. This nav bar changes colour as your hover over it, and the links change colour after you have visited it. This has all been done through css.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, there are examples of my plans and design ideas on the pages as I build up the storyline of the portfolio. On week 3 there is a detailed desgin of how I would like my website to look in the future. As part of that I would like to detail the use of css to change the look of backgrounds etc on the site.</p>
		<p>Week 4s task was the CSS project, which can be seen throughout the work presented. Week 10 was our lab on the reflection and OPTIONAL javascript task.</p>
		<!-- consider whether any other multi-media elements would be appropriate to achieve your chosen design -->
		<!-- Could be good to include examples of Swedish music - in form of video and audio, a spotify playlist if that is something that cane be done -->
		
		<p>This embedded table below details all of my sources, for research and images and justifies why I have used them. It is a Google Sheet which also automatically updates whenever I get work done!</p>
