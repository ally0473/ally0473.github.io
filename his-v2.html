    <h2>Modern History</h2>
    <p>Sweden's musical history is one that can be rivalled by few. From huge artists like Aviici and ABBA, to lesser known songwriters like Max Martin and Thomas G:Son, Sweden's musical history is widespread. This section will detail the modern history of the nation, looking closely at how pop and folk have merged together to create a musical powerhouse.</p>
    <p>Sweden's musical history, like many others, is steeped in culture and tradition. Throughout history, music played an important role in battles. The Swedish fiddle and nycklharp being important parts of music creation. By the turn on the mid-20th century however, pop music began to have more of an impact across the country. Pop music was not always popular however, with folk music, and even the national broadcaster being against what we now think as normal.</p>
    <p>The timeline below starts in the 1960's, after the creation of the <a href="uc-v1.html">Eurovision Song Contest and Swedish Melodifestivalen</a> but before their first victory. The timeline will detail wins and losses, and political moments, in the Swedish musical masterpiece.</p>

            <h2>1959</h2>
            <p><h3>The beginnings of Melodifestivalen</h3><br>After making their debut at Eurovision in 1958 and coming fourth, SVT (Sweden's broadcaster) adds a Eurovision selection to their show 'Säg det med musik'. The name given to this section became Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final (Eurovision Schlager, Swedish Final), but the winner didn't always go to Eurovision, only the song did.</p>
            <p>The name Melodifestivalen (Melody Festival) was adopted in 1967.</p>

            <p><h3>Zetturland launches Swedish music.</h3><br>Monica Zetterlund and the Bill Evans Trio record one of the most critically acclaimed Swedish albums of history, ‘Waltz for Debby’.

           <p><h3>Sweden vs pop.</h3><br>Sweden’s relationship with pop was not what it is now. Originally, music was based in the culture and folk, with rock bands coming out in the 60s against the establishment, and specifically against music competitions like Eurovision.</p>

              <p><h3>Sweden hosts Eurovision, just.</h3><br>Eurovision was not popular when it came to Sweden. Left-wing groups in the country were not happy with the commercialisation of music, and ran their own contest Alternativfestivalen (The Alternative Festival) during the week of Eurovision 1975. Money was also a problem due to the costs of the show, the country took a year out from Eurovision after this and the pressure against the broadcaster SR.</p>
